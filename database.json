They are the three ingredients or building blocks to work with to create a cohesive composition.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In this article, we explore how to create a simple single column layout with these design principles in detail. HTML and CSS will be the technologies that we will use as tools to create this layout. Doing this practice will help you learn key concepts and build your web development skills.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>1. Typography</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To set the type, CSS provides the following properties, <code>font-family</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code> and <code>font-weight</code>.<br><br>In this example, we are setting the font-family to Helvetica. It is web-safe, well-supported by browsers and very popular. We will set the font weight explicitly. The Helvetica font provides two standard font weights. We will set those explicitly to what the standard typically is 400 for and 700 for. <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Typography systems also set a ratio to the font-size and line-height. This is helpful as it helps you build visual hierarchy in your design. A good rule of thumb is to set the line-height to approximately 150% of the font size.</p><code>body {font-family: Helvetica;}<br>h1 {font-weight: 700;font-size: 2em;line-height: 3em;}<br>p {font-weight: 400;font-size: 1em;line-height: 1.5em;}</code><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>2. Spacing</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A lot of CSS frameworks and libraries use rows and columns to build layouts. In this example, we will are creating a simple layout so we will only work with rows. To implement design specifications like fixed or fluid width and manage the inner and outer spacing around your html elements, it is helpful to understand how the CSS box model works. You can find more information about it here on w3schools.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>For this example, we are only specifying the padding property for spacing around the row element. I have added a simple border property to use as a guideline when working with the spacing.</p><code>.row {padding: 0 1em;<br>border: solid 1px black;}</code><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3. Colour</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We will use a simple monochromatic greyscale colour palette with two combinations: black and white. They also have a sharp contrast and are polar opposites in colour theory. These CSS properties will help us create and apply a dark theme to the html element: colour and background.</p><code>.dark {background: #000;<br>colour: #fff;}</code><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><br>Here is the complete code on Code Pen with the resulting layout.<br><a href='https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-complete-css-style-guide-for-your-next-project-bb5a5d8f7bc9'>https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-complete-css-style-guide-for-your-next-project-bb5a5d8f7bc9</a></p>"

In this article, we take a look at some of them including how space is organised in Linux, some basic shell prompts that are useful to know that come in handy with everyday tasks.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Tree Structure of the Linux File System Hierarchy</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Linux organizes its space as a file system hierarchy starting with the root folder. All other subfolders are nested inside this root folder (denoted as a / in the figure below). This can be visualized as a tree structure. All users have their own folder under the home folder. When you first start the Linux shell prompt, you are asked to setup a username and password. This becomes your default directory or home directory for all future use.</p><br><img src='file-hierarchy.png'/><br><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Use this Linux shell prompt to print the current working directory.</p><code>$ pwd <br>/home/sadafzahra</code><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><br><br>To explore and view the contents of your working directory ls.</p><code>$ ls <br>code  data</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Use this shell prompt to navigate to the a specified path in the tree structure.</p><code>$ cd /foldername  </code><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To go up one level in the tree structure use the following.</p><code>$ cd ..</code><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Basic Shell Prompts for common File tasks</h2><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Use the following to make a new directory.</p><code>$ mkdir directoryname</code><br><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To create a file use the command cat > filename . Press enter to add file content. Use ctrl+ d to escape back into shell prompt.</p><code>$ cat > filename <br>press enter to type file content here<br>// ctrl+ d to escape back into the shell prompt</code><br><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To view the contents of a file use cat filename .</p><code>$ cat test.txt<br>test content shown here</code><br><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To remove a file or directory use rm filename .</p><code>$ rm filename</code>"

    "body": "<br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Before starting to write code for your application, taking some time to think about its basic architecture helps to give it a good structure to work with.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Most Front-end developers will start to write code for their application from the browser. But it helps to know how to setup a simple back-end to handle page routing and also allowing the browser to make requests like API calls.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In this article, we explore how to setup simple routes. Each route defined will load a new page when accessed as a URL in the browser.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Before your begin, make sure you have installed Node JS for your computer’s operating system. Use the following prompt to check if it is already installed or not.</p><code>$ node -v</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>First, setup a project directory. I’m using the Linux command line so I can use the following command to do this.</p><code>$ mkdir project-name</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Don’t forget to change directory to your project with $ cd project-name . Then initialize your project with npm which is the package manager for node and will install project dependencies like expressjs and setup scripts to test in the browser (this is further described below).</p><code>$ cd project-name<br>$ npm init //I accepted all the default values by pressing enter</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>After initializing your project with npm, you will see a package.json file appear in your project directory. Now install express with the following command. Once installed, you should see the package appear under dependencies in the package.json file.</p><code>$ npm install express --save</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Create a file called index.js in your project directory and add the following code.</p><code>const express = require('express')<br>const app = express()<br>app.get('/', function (req, res) {res.send('Home Page')})<br>app.get('/page1', function (req, res) {res.send('page1')})<br>app.listen(3000)</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Above we created an app object that uses the express js framework. We used the get() method available on the object to define a route and send a response to the browser that requested the page. We defined two routes / for the home page and /page1 for any other route that you want to define.<br><br>Finally, listen() method on the app will allow you to access the defined routes from the browser’s address bar. But first you have to run the index.js file like this.</p><code>$ node index.js</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Or in your package.json file your could add the following script and type npm start in your command prompt to run the script.</p><code>'scripts': {'test': 'echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1', 'start': 'node index.js'},</code><br><br><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Access the page routes you defined from the browser with the following.</p><code>http://localhost:3000/http://localhost:3000/page1</code>"}
